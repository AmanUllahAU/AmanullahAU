Iâ€™m a full-stack developer skilled in **Angular**, **React**, and **Next.js** for modern frontend apps.  
I use **Node.js** with **Prisma** and raw **SQL** for building powerful backend APIs.  
I work with both **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB** for efficient data handling.  
My code is clean, scalable, and production-ready.  
I deliver complete end-to-end web solutions.
